# RentMatch

RentMatch is an app that helps bring renters and land owners together.

## Documentation

RentMatch is structured using the MVC design pattern.

  - Controllers are split into subgroups as well, i.e. Model Controllers, View Controllers, and other controllers, such as a Firebase Controller that manages functionality having to do with Firebase.
